Book Me, now potentially renamed as Textbook Exchange provides a platform for Northwestern students, parents, and professors to buy and sell textbooks from one another and compare prices with online vendors. Textbook Exchange allows users to interface with each other through Facebook using the Facebook API. This functionality allows Textbook Exchange to replace Facebook groups that attempt to solve the same problem but in a significantly more inefficient way.
